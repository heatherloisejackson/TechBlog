# TechBlog
A blog application that allows users to view, create, and edit posts.

## Description
This blog has been created for the Tech community, so they can share ideas and opinions, as well as converse through comments. Once a user has signed up or has logged in, they can view all of their own posts on their dashboard, create a new post, edit their own posts, and comment on other user's posts. If the user decides not to make an account, they care limited to only being able to view existing posts.

This application was made as a way to practice a new understanding of Handlebars and the Model-View-Controller approach to web development. In order to create this complex full-stack application, I had to use everything I have learned in my journey this far, including Back End (Javascript, Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize) and Front End (HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript).

## Installation
